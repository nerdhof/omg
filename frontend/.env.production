# Production Environment Configuration
# This file is used when building for production (npm run build)

# Backend API URL
# Default: http://localhost:8000 (assumes backend is running locally)
# For deployed backends, override this value:
#   - Create a .env.production.local file (not tracked by git)
#   - Or set VITE_API_URL during build: VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com npm run build
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: CORS must be configured on the backend to accept requests from:
# https://USERNAME.github.io
